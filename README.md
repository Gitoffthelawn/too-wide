# Too Wide!

Sites such as, um, Wikipedia insist on using the full width of the screen.
For many of us, this means an renders the page much to wide to be comfortably readable.

This add-on adds a contextual (right-click) menu which allows you to toggle the width of the current page.

By default, the new width will be 960px. You can adjust this in preferences.

Although designed to work with Wikipedia and its cousins, it will also work with many other pages
designed a long long time ago, before wide screens became fashionable.
